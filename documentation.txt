DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Bought a domain on porkbun.com for x amount of years (andrewdaitruong.com)
2. Configured the domain to allow the use of GitHub Pages
    - Removed all current A Addresses and CNAME
    - Add 4 different A Addresses
        -> 185.199.108.153
        -> 185.199.109.153
        -> 185.199.110.153
        -> 185.199.111.153
    - Add CNAME which should be the domain, in my case andrewdaitruong.com

GETTING THE GITHUB SSH KEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In the terminal, use command "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" (Replace your_email@example.com with your GitHub email)
2. It will prompt you to enter a file name, a passphrase, verification of passphrase.
3. Go to the ssh.pub file location and open the file in a notepad. The Public Key should start with 'ssh-rsa'
    - By default it should be under C:\Users\Name\.ssh
4. After copying the Public Key, go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys
    - Click 'New SSH key'
    - Title the Key
    - Paste the key into the Key area
    - Click 'Add SSH key'
5. Now go to terminal and use command 'ssh -T git@github.com'
6. It should say "Are you sure you want to ..." type 'yes' and enter
7. It should be you a 'Warning:' But that can be ignored. 
    The main part is that it should say "Hi 'github username'! You've successfully authenticated..."

CONFIGURING GITHUB PAGES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create your repository
2. Open up VSC and add a folder called frontend in your repository and add a file called deploy.yml inside that folder
3. Make a main.py in the root folder
4. Initialize the repository and push everything into it
    - Note that when pushing, the deploy.yml will create a new branch for you called "gh-pages"

# ------------------ deploy.yml -------------------#
name: Deploy Frontend to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger whenever you push to main

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: ./frontend  # This tells it to only deploy the frontend folder
            publish_branch: gh-pages  # It will create a new branch called 'gh-pages'
            cname: # ADD DOMAIN NAME HERE 
# -----------------------------------------------------#

5. In your repository, go to Settings > Pages > Custom Domain 
    - Enter your domain
    - Under branches, I have mine set to gh-pages targetting the folder /(root) because I wanted to separate my HTML/CSS in a separate folder
        This allows me to save it to that branch from the main branch so I have a cleaner interface

MAKING THE FILES
1. Inside my frontend folder, I have all my HTML/CSS files as well as a photo called assets incase I want to add images.
2. Anything that I add, commit, push from now if it involves my frontend will also be written into the gh-pages branch 
    which should be the part that is showing on the website
